# climate-change
This repository will be used to provide research, inspire investment and implement action in regards to transforming the U.S.A.'s energy grid to renewable energy
This code begins as a series of .pdf documents, each involving one aspect of the effort to end climate change. There are documents entitled, "Research/Proof", "Investment", "Implementation" and "Testimonials".
Contributors are invited to add to the code by furnishing additional links to helpful resources, or to add resources themselves, in text form, supplementing any of these four sub-topics.
Additonally, periodic .m3u playlists will be added, which provide surveys of the American Media's coverage of climate change.
The goal is to create a collective strategy, pooling these resources and connections, to actively fund and implement the transformation of the energy grid of the U.S.A. to renewable energy.
