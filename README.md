# climate-change
This repository will be used to provide research, inspire investment and implement action in regards to transforming the U.S.A.'s energy grid to renewable energy
This code begins as a series of .pdf documents, each involving one aspect of the effort to end climate change. There are documents entitled, "Research/Proof", "Investment", "Implementation" and "Testimonials". Contributors are welcome to add text to these documents-- while doing so please follow the style guide of previous entries. 
An .m3u playlist has been added which provides a survey of the media's coverage of climate change.
The goal is to create a collective strategy, pooling these resources and connections, to actively fund and implement the transformation of the American energy grid.

If you have added text to the files, or wish to contribute other information, please e-mail me the material, to mystifiedthomas (at) gmail (dot) com.
